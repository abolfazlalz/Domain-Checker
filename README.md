# Domain Checker
This program can create a list of domain names with the given letters and check them.

[Armin](https://github.com/arminhero1) and I wanted to write a program a while ago to get a list of domains we can use for ssh with the letters we want.

Now I have written this program in the form of functional programming.

## How to run program
Put the letters you want to create a domain with after the program execution command

### Simple run command
```console
$ python3 code.py abcd
```
### Pipe command
this program support pipe commands in unix
```console
$ echo "abcd" | python3 code.py
```
